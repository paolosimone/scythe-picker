# Scythe Picker

Randomly selects a starting faction/board combination for the game of [Scythe](https://stonemaiergames.com/games/scythe/).

With respect to existing companion apps it also allows to optionally **limit the selection in a tier range** to keep the game as fair as possible.
The reference tier list has been created by the community (see [this thread](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2410237/new-scythe-tier-list)):
